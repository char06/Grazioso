# Grazioso

Databases: 
For this third category as part of my final project, I decided to work with an artifact that was completed during CS-340 Client/Server Development 
Artifact: Salvare Search for Rescue App.

Enhancement plan: 
As I had some problems submitting the initial milestones in this course, I'll start over with the application. Basically, I will develop a completely functional application based on the demands of the client and show that I am familiar with Python and how it interacts with MongoDB.
